This happens because of the presence of gases known as greenhouse gases (GHGs), including carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane. When CO2 and other GHGs absorb radiation from the sun, they trap some of it in their molecules, keeping more heat from escaping into space. This process, known as radiative forcing, helps to maintain Earth's climate by maintaining a balance between incoming solar energy and outgoing radiation.","3":"As an AI assistant, I can provide you with a detailed account of a day in the life of a time traveler visiting ancient Rome during the Roman Empire's golden age.
